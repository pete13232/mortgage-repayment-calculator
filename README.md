## My process

### Built with

- React (with Vite)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This challenge helped me deeply understand form validation, including how different input types and input states affect the user experience through error messages and feedback.

- I gained insight into handling more complex logic structures within a form.

- I went a bit beyond the original requirements by implementing typo handling. Although it was a small addition, it taught me a lot about managing state. For example, I asked myself:
How should I display error messages for each individual field?
What if each field has a different type of invalid inputâ€”one is empty, while another has a typo?
This made me consider how to structure and manage state in a more flexible and scalable way.

### Reflections & Future Improvements

- I'm feeling more comfortable with state management, but as the number of state variables grows, I still occasionally struggle with how to structure the logic cleanly. I plan to keep practicing this to improve my fluency and confidence.

- I noticed that my CSS is starting to feel messy. As a next step, I'd like to explore a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS to help keep my styles more organized and maintainable.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp - Front End Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) - This interactive course helped me learn the foundational concepts of React through short lessons and hands-on challenges. The built-in code validation system gives instant feedback, which is really helpful for beginners.
> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The auto-checking system on freeCodeCamp can be very strict. If you're confident your code is correct but it's not passing, consider using tools like ChatGPT to double-check or help debug your solution!
